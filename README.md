This is an expense tracker that I made using react.js

The point of this project is to demonstrate my basic and foundational knowledege of React. Through this project I was able to learn more about managing state, rendering arrays of data, passing data via props to components, and conditional rendering.

The application allows a user to enter in expense data through a form. Once the form is submitted the data is then passed and rendered through a chart and an expense list. This has enabled my application to be dynamic fundamentally and stylistically.

In the future I will implement the ability for data to be stored locally.
